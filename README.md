# HR Data Analysis
### Data Archive Activity for DAT1030 Data Analysis Tools for Analytics
The analysis was performed by Gillian Brabers as part of the above course's assignments and occurred during the period of October 18 to November 9, 2025.\
The business problem being analyzed was a comparison of monthly income in relation to salespeople with and without attrition. The data being analyzed can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset/data).\
The insights found are that there is a larger portion of employees with non attrition and the weighted average monthly income for those with non attrition is about $1,000 more than those with attrition. However, the most common monthly wage for those with non attrition is $5,000, and the most common monthly wage for those with attrition is tied between $2,000 and $5,000. These results suggest there could be a correlation between monthly income and attrition, although not apparently significant. Further analysis would need to be done to rule out additional factors.\
